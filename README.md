## Development

### Requirements

## Windows
1. Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2017 + Visual Studio 2019 Build Tools
2. Sandcastle Help Builder
3. Visual Studio Code with NSIS extension (from idleberg)

## Linux
1. MonoDevelop or Rider from Jetbrains
2. Visual Studio Code with NSIS extension (from idleberg)

### Compile and build
We provide the following build scripts with CruiseControl.NET:

## Windows
1. ```ps build.ps1 --target=default```

It will display the existing targets in the cake build script.

2. ```ps build.ps1 --target=build```

Use this if you want to build the project.

3. ```ps build.ps1 --target=build-all```

Full build, including running tests, doing some code analysis and packaging artifacts.
Cleanup -> Init -> Build -> Unit Tests -> code Analysis -> Packaging

4. ```ps build.ps1 --target=run-tests```

This will call only the runUnitTests target in ccnet.build script.
Cleanup -> Init -> Build -> Unit Tests

5. ```ps build.ps1 --target=package```

This only build and package the CruiseControl.NET distribution.
Cleanup -> Init -> Build -> Packaging

The packaged distribution can be found in the "Publish" folder.

6. ```ps build.ps1 --target=web-packages```

This builds and packages the project WebDashboards.

If running powershell scripts are disabled on your machine, you can run powershell with ExecutionPolicy disabled for the CruiseControl.NET build file:

```powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File ./build.ps1 -target=build```

## Linux
If you just cloned the CruiseControl.NET repository, run ```chmod u+x build.sh``` so you have execute permission on the build script.

1. ```./build.sh --target=default```

It will display the existing targets in the cake build script.

2. ```./build.sh --target=build```

Use this if you want to build the project.

3. ```./build.sh --target=build-all```

Full build, including running tests, doing some code analysis and packaging artifacts.
Cleanup -> Init -> Build -> Unit Tests -> code Analysis -> Packaging

4. ```./build.sh --target=run-tests```

This will call only the runUnitTests target in ccnet.build script.
Cleanup -> Init -> Build -> Unit Tests

5. ```./build.sh --target=package```

This only build and package the CruiseControl.NET distribution.
Cleanup -> Init -> Build -> Packaging

The packaged distribution can be found in the "Publish" folder.

6. ```./build.sh --target=web-packages```

This builds and packages the project WebDashboards.

				    <p class="paragraph">The CCNet Project Report Web Application is used for reporting the status of all the builds for a project. To install it:</p><ol>
<li> Unzip the distribution as described in <a href="Basic Installation.html" title="Basic Installation">Basic Installation</a></li>
<li> In IIS, map a virtual directory to the &#039;web&#039; subfolder of your CCNet folder</li>
</ol><br/>
Make sure you have enabled &#039;default.aspx&#039; as a &#039;Default Document&#039; in your IIS config.<p class="paragraph">For the project report to work, you need to generate build logs on your CCNet Server. To do this, make sure you have setup your Project to have an <a href="Xml Log Publisher.html" title="Xml Log Publisher">Xml Log Publisher</a>.</p><img class="rendericon" src="./icons/emoticons/information.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> The Project Report Web Application will not work until you have run a build and generated a build log (either for a successful or failed build, it doesn&#039;t matter which)<p class="paragraph">To configure the webapp, you need to set the &#039;<b class="strong">logDir</b>&#039; value in the &#039;<b class="strong">appSettings</b>&#039; section of the <b class="strong">web.config</b> file, to be the <b class="strong">absolute path</b> of the <a href="Xml Log Publisher.html#XmlLogPublisher-logDir" title="logDir on Xml Log Publisher">Xml Log Publisher log directory</a>. The typical value for this is :
<ul class="star">
<li> c: \ program files \ CruiseControl.NET \ server \ <em class="emphasis"><b class="strong">projectName</b></em> \ artifacts \ buildlogs \</li>
</ul><br/>
<img class="rendericon" src="./icons/emoticons/information.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> If in doubt of what your project build log should be, run a build on the server and then explore your CruiseControl.NET directory to find where the logs are going.<br/>
<img class="rendericon" src="./icons/emoticons/warning.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> The default log file locations changed in version 0.7 - make sure you have configured your directory correctly. If you want to use the pre-0.7 default location (i.e. the <tt class="monospaced">log</tt> sub-directory in the web directory), see the note in the <a href="Xml Log Publisher.html" title="Xml Log Publisher">Xml Log Publisher</a> documentation.<br/>
<img class="rendericon" src="./icons/emoticons/information.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> The Project Web Application will be deprecated in a not-to-far-away release and the replacement will be much easier to configure!</p><h3 class="heading3"><a name="ProjectReportWebApplication-ReportingMultipleProjects"> Reporting Multiple Projects</a></h3><p class="paragraph">The Project Report Web Application <b class="strong">does not</b> support reporting multiple projects. To do this, you&#039;ll need to do one of the following:
<ul class="star">
<li> Copy the project report directory to a different location and setup a separate virtual directory</li>
<li> Use the the project reporting features of the <a href="Web Dashboard.html" title="Web Dashboard">Web Dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading3"><a name="ProjectReportWebApplication-AdvancedCCNetWebApplicationFeatures"> Advanced CCNet Web Application Features</a></h3>
<ul class="star">
<li> <a href="Project Report Web Application Plugins.html" title="Project Report Web Application Plugins">Project Report Web Application Plugins</a></li>
<li> <a href="Server Log.html" title="Server Log">Server Log</a></li>
<li> <a href="Using CruiseControl.NET with NCover.html" title="Using CruiseControl.NET with NCover">Using CruiseControl.NET with NCover</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading3"><a name="ProjectReportWebApplication-FxCopSummary"> FxCop Summary</a></h3></p>The fxcop summary at the bottom of the web page only shows the fxcop rule violations for the files that were included as part of the current build (ie. the files that have been added or modified since the last build).  The rationale is that most projects consist of hundreds, if not thousands, of rule violations (according to Microsoft <img class="rendericon" src="./icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>)  Looking through this list, it is very hard to figure out where to start, let alone which violations are relevant to your changes.  So the fxcop summary is designed to give you a view at a glance of some fixes that you might want to start making in an area of the codebase that you will be familiar with.

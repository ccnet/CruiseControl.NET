				    <p>As CruiseControl.NET is based on the original Java implementation of <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net">CruiseControl</a>, we are frequently asked why we bothered to reimplement it for the .NET platform.  Surely, it would be easier to just use the NAnt builder in CruiseControl to handle the build process for .NET projects.</p>

<p>Here are some of the reasons behind the implementation of CruiseControl.NET:</p>
<ol>
	<li>We wanted to be able to explore and take advantage of features of the .NET platform</li>
	<li>We wanted to be able to reach out to and work with the growing pool of .NET developers.  As the project is open source, it is driven largely by the community.  We would not have this level of participation from .NET developers if the code was implemented in java.</li>
	<li>Competition is good. Both CCNet and <a href="http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/">Damagecontrol</a> have spurred and inspired the development of both the <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net">Java version of CruiseControl</a> and of each other. Features from CCNet have been implemented in the CruiseControl-Java and we have borrowed from them as well.</li>
	<li>If we didn't do it, someone else would.  in fact there are several other ports of CruiseControl to the .NET platform <a href="http://draconet.sourceforge.net">out there</a>.</li>
	<li>While you could use CC-Java to build .NET projects, some of our users are using CCNet to build java projects.</li>
	<li>Many of our clients and many of our users are microsoft-only shops. They would not have the experience, interest or investment in installing, setting up and maintain a Java server.</li>
</ol>

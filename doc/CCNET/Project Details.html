				    <p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"><a name="ProjectDetails-OpenSource"> Open Source</a></h2></p>CruiseControl.NET is an Open Source project. This means it is free to use, and the source code is also available and distributable under a few conditions. Our <a href="License.html" title="License">License</a> is very similar to the Apache &amp; BSD licenses.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"><a name="ProjectDetails-ProjectManagement"> Project Management</a></h2></p>The CruiseControl.NET source trees and email lists are hosted on SourceForge under the <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/ccnet" title="Visit page outside Confluence">ccnet</a> project.<p class="paragraph">We don&#039;t use Sourceforge for bug and feature tracking, instead look at our <a href="Issues.html" title="Issues">Issues</a> page.</p>At ThoughtWorks we believe in lightweight methodologies. This fits in well with an open source project so project decisions tend to be made in an ad-hoc fashion, normally by some kind of consesus on the <em class="emphasis">CCNet-Devel</em>&#160;<a href="Mailing Lists.html" title="Mailing Lists">mailing list </a>.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"><a name="ProjectDetails-Submittingupdates"> Submitting updates</a></h2></p>We welcome patches and updates to the code and documentation for CruiseControl.NET. If you want to do this, the best way is to email the ccnet-devel list with your change.<p class="paragraph">The format of your submission ideally should be a description of what you have done, along with an associated CVS patch (if you don&#039;t know how to create a CVS patch, you probably want to use Eclipse as your CVS client since it has a good GUI for creating them). If your patch includes files &gt; 40kb, please don&#039;t send it to the list. Instead, email the list with a description of your patch, and one of the admin team will reply off-list so that you can send the files just to one person.</p>If you do want to make a submission, please make sure you read up about our <a href="Contributor License Agreement.html" title="Contributor License Agreement">Contributor License Agreement</a>.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"><a name="ProjectDetails-ReleaseProcess"> Release Process</a></h2></p>We use <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet" title="Visit page outside Confluence">CCNetLive </a> to produce new distributions of CCNet every time a CCNet developer checks in new code.  You can download the source or binary packages from <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/CCNet-builds/" title="Visit page outside Confluence">here </a>.<p class="paragraph">We also periodically produce stable releases that are posted on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71179&amp;package_id=83198" title="Visit page outside Confluence">SourceForge download site </a>.  The process of producing new stable releases is as follows:</p><ol>
<li> Create new release notes using the <a href="http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/ConfigureReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10000" title="Visit page outside Confluence">CCNet Jira </a>.</li>
<li> Add a new page to Confluence (child of <a href="Download.html" title="Download">Download</a>) to contain generated release notes.</li>
<li> <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/spaces/exportspace.action?key=CCNET" title="Visit page outside Confluence">Export </a> Confluence space as Html.   Extract the exported zip into your local ccnet\docs folder, and then check the modified Html files into CVS.  This way the next CCNetLive build will package the latest documentation from Confluence.</li>
<li> Tag all source in the CCNet CVS module with the new version number (i.e. ccnet_0_6_final)</li>
<li> Download the source and binary distributions from <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/CCNet-builds/" title="Visit page outside Confluence">CCNetLive </a> that contain the newly packaged documentation</li>
<li> Upload the source and binary distributions to <a href="ftp://upload.sourceforge.net/incoming" title="Visit page outside Confluence">SourceForge </a> and go through the SourceForge release process.  Rename the distribution files to include the version number!  (Distributions with the same filenames can cause problems for SourceForge mirrors).</li>
<li> Add news of the release on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ccnet" title="Visit page outside Confluence">SourceForge </a> and the <a href="News.html" title="News">Confluence news blog</a>.</li>
<li> Email the <a href="mailto:ccnet-user@lists.sourceforge.net" title="Send mail to CCNet users list ">CCNet users list </a> to notify the users that the new release is ready.</li>
<li> Set the currently released version to <a href="http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/secure/project/ViewProject.jspa?pid=10000" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&quot;Released&quot; </a> on the Jira.</li>

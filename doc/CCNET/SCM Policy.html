				    <p>This page describes Source Control, Build Management and Issue Tracking policy for the CruiseControl.NET project.</p>

<p><img class="emoticon" src="./icons/emoticons/warning.gif" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> This is how CruiseControl.NET manages itself as a project in development. If you are just <b>using</b> CruiseControl.NET you of course do not need to follow these same guidelines, but you might find them useful as a example.</p>

<h2><a name="SCMPolicy-SourceControl">Source Control</a></h2>

<p>CruiseControl.NET uses the CVS Source Control server offered by SourceForge.net. CVS access details for the project can be seen <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=71179" title="Visit page outside Confluence">here</a> .</p>

<p>The main CruiseControl.NET project can be found in the <tt>ccnet</tt> module under the project source control root.</p>

<p>CruiseControl.NET is tagged on every successful build by its own Continuous Integration process. These tags have a name related to the build number so look like (for example) <tt>ver-1_0_0_1201</tt> .</p>

<p>CruiseControl.NET uses branches only to allow stable releases to be maintained while at the same time offer mainline iterative development. We use the release branching method, as described very well by the book <em><a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/vcc/index.html" title="Visit page outside Confluence">Pragmatic Source Control Using CVS</a></em> . This means that if we have a release branch active we may decide to fix bugs on that branch, and then merge changes to the trunk. Apart from in extreme circumstances (and occasionally at the start of a branch) we <b>never</b> merge from the trunk to the branch.</p>

<h3><a name="SCMPolicy-WorkingontheTrunk">Working on the Trunk</a></h3>

<p>Most work should be performed on the trunk. For this scenario, just check out the <tt>ccnet</tt> module without specifying any branch or version.</p>

<h3><a name="SCMPolicy-WorkingontheBranch">Working on the Branch</a></h3>

<p>A release branch should <b>only</b> be used when both of the following cases are true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A release branch is currently <em>active</em> for changes</li>
	<li>The change is absolutely required as part of a new release off the branch</li>
</ul>


<p>Working on the release branch is slightly more complicated that working on the trunk. The following examples are using the cvs command line and the first CruiseControl.NET release branch called <b><tt>RB_1_0</tt></b> :</p>
<ol>
	<li>Check out the branch to a <b>separate</b> working directory : <tt>cvs -d:ssh:mikeroberts@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ccnet co -r RB_1_0 -d ccnetrb1.0 ccnet</tt></li>
	<li><b>OR</b> if you have already checked out the branch, make sure it is <b>clean</b> and <b>up to date</b>. Please try <b>not</b> to checkin more than one <em>logical change</em> to the branch at once since it makes tracking merges back to the trunk a nightmare</li>
	<li>Make your changes in this directory</li>
	<li>Commit as normal</li>
</ol>


<p>Once your change has passed in CCNetLive, you need to <b>merge your changes back to the trunk</b> .</p>

<p>To do this, do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure you have a <em>clean</em> working directory of the trunk which is up-to-date and as no pending changes (if necessary check out a new working directory somewhere else on your machine)</li>
	<li>Perform a merge in the root of your CCNet Trunk working directory. Use the tags that were created by CCNetLive immediately before and after your change.

(The <tt>-q</tt> is to make output quieter, and the <tt>-d</tt> makes sure any new directories were included in the change.)  </td></tr></table></div></div>

	<li>Commit, mentioning in your commit message that you have done a merge, and what versions you merged

<h3><a name="SCMPolicy-Creatinganewbranch">Creating a new branch</a></h3>

<p>First make sure that the all changes to the trunk have built successfully. Then, using the cvs command line, issue the following command in a trunk working directory:</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>cvs -rtag -b</tt> <em><tt>BranchName</tt></em> <tt>ccnet</tt></li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, update the Branching History table above, making note of the label created by the last CCNetLive build.</p>

				    <p>From the perspective of CruiseControl.NET, InstallShield is just another application, which can be run directly with the <em>exec</em> task or indirectly via NAnt or MSBuild.  For many people, the hard part is just learning how to invoke InstallShield from the command line.</p>

<p>The following information relates to InstallShield for Windows 11.5, but similar features are available for other versions.</p>

<p>The InstallShield tool for building from the command line is <b>IsCmdBld.exe</b>.  It's documented in the InstallShield help library and user's guide.  You may find it useful to build in quiet mode (-s), as otherwise it produces a large amount of text output on stdout.  Unfortunately, it doesn't produce an XML output log, but CruiseControl.Net is good about picking up error messages from the text.</p>

<p>While some control of the installation build can be done directly from the command line, you may also find it useful to use InstallShield's <em>environment path variables</em>.  These can be used, for example, to tell InstallShield to pick up the file for the kit from the CC.Net working directory.</p>
